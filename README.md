# `jazzsequence.github.io`

This is my personal profile page with all my various social and other links published to [jazzsequence.github.io](https://jazzsequence.github.io).

It was built with [profile.github.io](https://github.com/jazzsequence/profile.github.io).

## What is this?

I have a lot of interests and social media profiles. One thing I see a lot of on social media is people using `linktr.ee` to share their various links on their profile pages that only allow a single link. I've even thought of making a profile there myself.

But, I'm a web developer and at the end of the day, those sorts of services are just giving you a web page with a bunch of links. I thought I could build something quickly without too much complexity that could provide the same thing and allow you to deploy it wherever you want. Having played around with React and GitHub Pages recently, it seemed like a pretty simple thing to just push a single page app to a GitHub page.

## How does it work?

## Making changes

1. Make sure you have Node **16** installed and active. If using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use 16` to switch to Node 16.
2. Assuming you already have a copy of the repository cloned, make your changes in `src/details.js`. You can test locally by running `npm run dev` or just build the changes with `npm run build`.
3. Commit your changes and push to GitHub.
4. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy your changes to GitHub Pages.
